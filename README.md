## Requirments

These are a series of modules/tools required for the project to properly run on Linux, Windows 7 or higher, and Mac OS. 

- python 3.8 =<
- poetry
- SQLite
- Qt 6

### Recommendation

The following platforms are suggestions to facilitate working with program and coding in general. These development requirements are to improve visualization of data structure, tracking work flow, or/and help with systematic coding. 

- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip)
- [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/ "Git Kraken")
- [Qt 6](https://www.qt.io/product/qt6)

Pycharm is the recommended IDE for coding any python related projects. Since poetry is used as the python packet manager, Pycharm provides different tools that can be used to improve coding along with python CLI. DataGrip is used for SQL/SQLite codes. The IDE enables programmers to concurrently use multiple different data management systems, such as Oracle RDBMS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and etc. in a templated project. Git Karaken enables programers to visualize git tracking, commits, and branches.
